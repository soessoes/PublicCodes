# Deep-learning course (CS230) Project
## Title: Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Brain MR Images
### Contributors: Soheil Esmaeilzadeh, Dimitrios Ioannis Belivanis
#### For this project we are going to use a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) voxel based approach with preprocessed MR-Images  gathered from [ADNI dataset](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/), which counts for all the voxels of the brain in order to capture the subtle local brain details in addition to more pronounced global details in MR-Images.
