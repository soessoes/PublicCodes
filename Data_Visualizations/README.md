# Data Visualization

In this part, I have put together 3 categoris of python codes for plotting data. Data sets are given in the __Dataset Folder__. 

The first one named as __1.Static_Plotting.ipynb__ shows how regular plots can made out of two dimensional data in a flexible way of changing different characteristics of the plot and complex annotatings.

The second one named as __2.Multi Dimensional Plotting.ipynb__ illustrates different forms of plottings available for multi dimensional data e.g. from 1D to 6D.

The second one named as __3.Interactive_Plotting.ipynb__ illustrates different ways of interactive dynamic plottings in python where user can manually interact and changes plots and see changes inline on the plots. For viewing the code you can use this link from nbviewer, [See The Notebook Here!](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/soheilesm/MyPublicCodes/blob/master/Data_Visualizations/3.Interactive_Plotting.ipynb)
